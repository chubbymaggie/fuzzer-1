class ExploitStrategy:
  """
  Implements the Strategy Pattern for exploits.

  Justification: exploits are very similar and only differ in their behvior. 
  Using the strategy pattern, we can configure just one class with one of many 
  behaviors

  Example usage:

  sanitization = Exploit({type of exploit}, [pages to fuzz])
  sanitization.execute()
